Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    30 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  30
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         46 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       45 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              25
      Number using O5 output only:              12
      Number using O5 and O6:                    8
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        14 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                13
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    14 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           46
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            16 out of      46   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      46    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          30 out of      46   65%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         4 out of     480    1%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Peak Memory Usage:  314 MB
